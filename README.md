# CPU Scheduler Simulation

## Project Description

This project is a CPU scheduler simulation implemented using C++, Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a web interface to simulate different CPU scheduling algorithms such as First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job Next (SJN), Priority Scheduling, Round Robin, and Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF). Users can input process details and select an algorithm to visualize the scheduling process and view performance metrics.
